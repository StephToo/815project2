The input code simulates an experiment with two configurable parameters. 
The parameters feed into a probability distribution that also has its own probability function.

The parameters for each can be set within the program.

The simulated experiment is meant to look at the height devaiatons from average (in a normal distribution) fir 
men born in first and second halves of the year.

With chosen input parameters, the output code will generate a histogram for each half of the year and plot
the two histrograms on top of one another.
